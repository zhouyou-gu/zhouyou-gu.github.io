Hello, my name is Zhouyou Gu, and I am an experienced researcher in wireless networks with a background in machine learning system design.

Education
------
I received the B.E. (Hons.) and M.Phil. degrees from The University of Sydney (USYD), Australia, in 2016 and 2019, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, USYD, in 2023. Throughout my studies, I was fortunate to work under the supervision of Wibowo Hardjawana and Branka Vucetic, which provided me with invaluable insights and guidance in my research endeavors.

Experience
------
Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to collaborate on significant projects with industry leaders. One such project was a collaboration between the University of Sydney and Telstra, where I contributed to the development of an open programmable scheduler for LTE networks. This project involved designing and implementing an online learning system to program the resource scheduler in a real-world 5G network built on Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Another notable collaboration was with Morse Micro, where I designed a time-slot allocation algorithm combining machine learning and graph theory to manage interference in Wi-Fi Halow networks. These projects have not only enhanced my technical expertise but also provided me with a practical understanding of industry requirements and challenges. In addition to my research and project experience, I have also been actively involved in academic tutoring and voluntary demonstrations at the University of Sydney. I have served as a research assistant, assisting in supervising undergraduate and master students' theses, arranging meetings, and managing the ad-hoc activities of a research group.
