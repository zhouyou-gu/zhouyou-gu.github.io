## Biography

(M,IEEE) I received the B.E. (Hons.) and M.Phil. degrees from The University of Sydney (USYD), Australia, in 2016 and 2019, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from [Centre for IoT and Telecommunications](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/internet-of-things/centre-for-iot-and-telecommunications.html) at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, USYD, in 2023.

Throughout my studies, I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Dr. Wibowo Hardjawana](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/wibowo-hardjawana.html) and [Prof. Branka Vucetic](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/branka-vucetic.html), which provided me with invaluable guidance in my research endeavors. My Ph.D. thesis focuses on ["Scheduler Designs in Wireless Networks"](https://hdl.handle.net/2123/31508) and my works are published in prestigious journals and conferences, e.g., TON, JSAC and TWC etc.

My research interests span in machine learning and graph theory in wireless networks.

*Collaborations from both industry and academia are highly welcomed. If you are interested in my researches, feel free to reach out!*

## Research Outputs

My research has contributed to the advancement of wireless network technologies, which includes but not limited to the following areas.

### Algorithms

Algorithms have been designed in my research to address challenges in different aspects of network optimizations.

- **AC-GRL** enables flexible network-wise coordination by embedding neural networks in graph theory methods. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00879)
- **MVWO** accelerates convergence of scheduling policy using statistical information, e.g., mean and variance of network states. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08238)
- **K-DDPG** improves quality of service of reinforcement learning in networks by integrating domain-expert knowledge. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08346)

### Architectures

My research also involves network system architecture designs.  

- **ac-grl-wi-fi**, a gym-like simulation platform for network-wise time-slot allocation algorithms in Wi-Fi, prototyped using NS-3. [Github](https://github.com/zhouyou-gu/ac-grl-wi-fi)

- **drl-5g-scheduler**, an online neural network fine-tuning archiecture for 5G radio access networks, operating at per millisecond level, prototyped using srsRAN, USRP Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Nvidia GPU. [Github](https://github.com/zhouyou-gu/drl-5g-scheduler)

- **OPSCH**, a vendor-neutral programming interface for schedulers in 5G networks, prototyped using OpenAirInterface and srsRAN. [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9120582)

- **M-AP**, a multi-tenant virtualization architecture with channel and beacon controls in Wi-Fi, prototyped using WARP SDR Platform. [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8407005)

## Collaborations
