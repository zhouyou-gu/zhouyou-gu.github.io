## Biography

My research explores the intersection of graph theory and artificial intelligence to advance wireless networks.

(M,IEEE) I am currently a research fellow of [Prof. Jihong Park](https://sites.google.com/view/jihong-park) at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I was a research fellow of [Prof. Jinho Choi](https://experts.deakin.edu.au/45933-jinho-choi) at Deakin University in 2024 and was a research assistant of [Prof. Branka Vucetic](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/branka-vucetic.html) at the University of Sydney (USYD) in 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Centre for IoT and Telecommunications](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/internet-of-things/centre-for-iot-and-telecommunications.html) at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, USYD, Australia, in 2023, where I also obtained the B.E. (Hons.) and the M.Phil. degrees from USYD in 2016 and 2019, respectively. Throughout my studies, I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Dr. Wibowo Hardjawana](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/wibowo-hardjawana.html) and [Prof. Branka Vucetic](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/branka-vucetic.html), which provided me with invaluable guidance in my research endeavors. My Ph.D. thesis focuses on ["Scheduler Designs in Wireless Networks"](https://hdl.handle.net/2123/31508) and my works are published in prestigious journals and conferences, e.g., TON, JSAC and TWC etc.

It is also my honor to have had collaborations with colleagues from

- **Morse Micro** (A fabless semiconductor startup): Together, we investigated the interference management using restricted access window (RAW) in Wi-Fi Halow networks. (2022-2023)

- **SmartSatCRC** (Australia's leading space research center): Together, we investigated advanced satellite communications for high rate and dynamic service delivery. (2020)

- **Telstra** (Australia's largest telecommunications company): Together, we investigated open programmable schedulers of 4G/5G networks and open radio access networks (O-RANs). (2018-2019)

## Research Outputs

My research has contributed to the advancement of wireless network technologies, which includes but not limited to the following areas.

### Algorithms

Algorithms have been designed in my research to address challenges in different aspects of networks.

- **AC-GRL** enables flexible network-wise coordination by embedding neural networks in graph theory methods. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00879)\
<span style="background-color: #AED6F1;">üéØ*To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to train neural networks to flexibly construct the optimal graph representing the impact of interference on specific network performance.*</span>

- **MVWO** accelerates convergence of scheduling policy using statistical information, e.g., mean and variance of network states. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08238)\
<span style="background-color: #AED6F1;"> üéØ*To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to accelerate max-weight schedulers' convergence using limited prior knowledge of statistical channel state information, e.g., the mean and variance of users‚Äô channel states, that costs only few samples to estimate.*</span>


- **K-DDPG** improves quality of service of reinforcement learning in networks by integrating domain-expert knowledge. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08346)\
<span style="background-color: #AED6F1;"> üéØ*To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an end-to-end solution of a deep-reinforcement-learning-based scheduler design in cellular networks from theoretical formulation to a real-time prototype.*</span>

<span style="background-color: #AED6F1;"> üéØ*To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gym-like simulation platform for machine-learning-based slot-allocation in Wi-Fi.*</span>


- **drl-5g-scheduler**, an online neural network fine-tuning archiecture for 5G radio access networks (RANs), operating at per millisecond level, prototyped using srsRAN, USRP Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Nvidia GPU. [Github](https://github.com/zhouyou-gu/drl-5g-scheduler)\
<span style="background-color: #AED6F1;"> üéØ*To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation to use a neural network to schedule transmissions per transmission time interval in a real-world RAN and simultaneously fine-tune the neural network's weights online.*</span>
